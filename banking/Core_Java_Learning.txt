Interface:

It is a collection of group of method name(with return type and arguments).
It is used by other classes using implements keyword.
Hence, all the set of groups created in interface will be mandatority popped up in those classes.
So, there will be many classed with same method names but different functions. 
To use in main class all we have to do is,
interfaceclassname objectname = new otherclassname();
Hence only the methods common to interfaceclassname will be displayed when we access objectname.
